Year-End Sales Peak
After a slow start—February hits a low of ₵69K—sales climb sharply in the last quarter, jumping from ₵203K in October to ₵338K in December. Planning inventory builds and promotional campaigns around this holiday surge could drive even stronger results.

Uneven Regional Performance
The Western territory pulls in the most revenue (≈₵710K), trailed by the East (≈₵670K), Central (≈₵490K) and South (≈₵390K). Since the South lags behind, region-specific promotions or product assortments there may help boost its share.

Tech Dominance in Product Mix
Technology accounts for the largest slice of revenue—about two-fifths of total sales—while Furniture and Office Supplies each hover near one-third. Doubling down on exclusive tech offerings or service add-ons could capitalize on your strongest category.

Consistent Order Growth
Annual order counts have risen steadily from roughly 2,000 in 2016 to 3,300 in 2019, signaling expanding customer reach and repeat purchases. Ensuring your logistics and fulfillment scale with this upward trend will be crucial.
